## Ongoing Updates

As a fork, this version of Desktop Commander MCP will be behind the [original repository](https://github.com/wonderwhy-er/DesktopCommanderMCP/). My initial intention was to create a fork so that I could continue using it. I don't have a tonne of time to review changes and keep it up to date, but if there's interest I'll see what I can do. Any help and/or [pull requests](https://github.com/delano/DesktopCommanderMCP-with-privacy/pulls) are welcome.
